# GeometricWitness_FHE

**GeometricWitness_FHE** is a secure multi-party protocol for private geometric intersection analysis with witness generation. Using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), it enables multiple parties to determine whether their encrypted geometric shapes intersect and, if an intersection exists, to generate an encrypted witness point without revealing the underlying shapes.

---

## Project Overview

Collaborative geometric computations face several challenges:

* **Data Privacy:** Geometric datasets may be sensitive and must remain confidential.
* **Multi-Party Computation:** Multiple parties may want to jointly determine intersections without revealing private shapes.
* **Proof of Intersection:** Parties require verifiable evidence of intersections without exposing raw data.
* **Computational Complexity:** Geometric intersection tests and witness computations are non-trivial in encrypted space.

**GeometricWitness_FHE** leverages FHE to enable secure computation on encrypted shapes, allowing intersection detection and encrypted witness generation while preserving privacy.

## Key Features

### Encrypted Geometric Intersection

* Determine if multiple geometric shapes intersect without revealing the shapes
* Works with points, polygons, and other geometric primitives
* Supports multi-party data submissions

### Witness Generation

* Produces an encrypted witness point when intersection exists
* Verifiable without exposing underlying geometric data
* Facilitates proofs for downstream computations or agreements

### Privacy and Security

* All geometric data is encrypted using FHE before computation
* Computation occurs entirely on encrypted data
* No party gains access to raw shapes or sensitive geometry information

### Multi-Party Collaboration

* Parties submit encrypted shapes independently
* The protocol supports secure aggregation and intersection computation
* Scales to multiple participants while maintaining privacy guarantees

## How FHE is Applied

1. **Local Encryption:** Each party encrypts their geometric dataset locally using FHE.
2. **Encrypted Intersection Computation:** The server or protocol computes intersections directly on encrypted data.
3. **Encrypted Witness Generation:** If an intersection exists, an encrypted witness point is produced.
4. **Result Delivery:** Only authorized parties can decrypt witness points while shape data remains encrypted.

**Benefits:**

* Complete confidentiality of geometric data
* Secure multi-party computation without centralized data sharing
* Verifiable proofs of intersection without exposing private information
* Applicable to privacy-sensitive geospatial or computational geometry scenarios
